<!-- Generally when you are working with the DOM you will be working with elements since most often you want to interact with HTML elements. Nodes are the more generic version of an element. A node could be an HTML element, but it could also be anything else in an HTML document, such as text or comments.
  HTMLCollection is a collection of document elements. A NodeList is a collection of document nodes.HTMLCollection items can be accessed by their name, id or index number, NodeList item can only be accessed by their index number. -->
